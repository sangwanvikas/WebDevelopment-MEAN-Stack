    <p> JavaScript can be declared and embedded within HTML documents, but it is usually a better idea to declare the scripts outside of the document and then load them separately by refering to them using the src attribute of the script element. </p>
    <p> MANDATORY TO DO SO FOR ASSIGNMENTS AND PROJECTS </p>

    <p> The code below loads three common JavaScript source files used throughout the course.
        <ul>
           <li> &lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.5/angular.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;script src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</li>
                
                
                
</ul>
The first three script elements load three common JavaScript libraries used throughout this course: jQuery, AngularJS, and Bootstrap. 
    The last script, main.js, is downloaded from the same server where the HTML document is being downloaded. 
    The remote scripts are loaded from remote servers in separate HTTP GET requests. 
        <b>These scripts could have been copied onto the local server and then downloaded from there instead of the remote server. </b>
    Although this might seem safer, it actually is not. 
    The servers from which they are downloaded from are special repositories called CDNs or Content Delivery Networks that are "guaranteed" to be available, 
    perhaps even more available than our local servers, but if our server is not available, neither will the enclosing HTML document be available :) 
    Scripts hosted in CDNs also have a performance advantage over local scripts. Since these are well known URLs, 
    developers of various other sites tend to use them often as well. Browsers that have visited these other sites will cache them locally and not re-download
    them when they get to our site. </p>
