This project is being developed as a part of the course CS5610 taught by Prof. Jose Annunziato. I relished learning new technologies in this course that I could use to channel my ideas to diverse practical implementations. 

1. I have designed UI for a project (Name - FormMaker) using HTML5, bootstrap and CSS. HTML pages are available in WebDevelopment-MEAN-Stack/public/assignment/.
2. I have also created a simple HTTP server ( WebDevelopment-MEAN-Stack/server.js) in NodeJS which serves requested HTML files to the client.
3. Hosted application on OpenShift (PaaS).

Well, If you are still reading this readme file then I would love to tell you more about this project. It is a Web application I will be building throughout the assignments is called Form Maker. It will consist of a Website that allow users to create forms and share them on the Web as single pages or embedded in their own Web pages. Users who will create forms are called Developers. And other users that visit the Web pages or form pages can then fill in and submit the forms are calles Submitters. Developers can login to their account and see the results in tabular format or download them as CSV files.

This Web application will be built on the MEAN stack using the four underpinning technologies MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.

I have started this project creating a static set of pages that will serve as a prototype of the final application. The prototype will allow evaluating user interface aspects of the application such as navigation, information layout, page dependencies, modalities, authentication and authorization. Although the pages will have links, forms and buttons to interact with, the application won't actually do anything yet. It will only be an empty shell for now. I will add the functionality as I progress through the rest of the web development classes.
